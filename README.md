Lab Overview
This lab focuses on delivering the most valuable working software while strictly following an assigned software development methodology.
The objective is to understand how development processes impact:
•	Productivity
•	Software Quality
•	Adaptability to change
Our team developed a Command-Line Campus Event Manager in Python that allows users to manage campus events efficiently through a simple terminal interface.
________________________________________
Project Description
The Command-Line Campus Event Manager is a Python-based application that enables users to create, manage, and search campus events directly from the command line.
The system is designed to be:
•	Simple
•	Modular
•	Easy to extend
•	Maintainable
________________________________________
Features (Product Backlog)
The application includes the following core features:
1.	Add an Event
o	Create a new campus event
o	Store event name, date, location, and description
2.	View All Events
o	Display a list of all created events
o	Show detailed event information
3.	Register an Attendee
o	Add an attendee to a specific event
o	Store attendee name and contact information
4.	Cancel an Event
o	Remove an event from the system
o	Ensure associated attendee data is handled appropriately
5.	Search for Events
o	Search events by name or keyword
o	Return matching results

Software Development Methodology
This project was developed following an assigned software development methodology (e.g., Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, or Kanban depending on team assignment).
Process Highlights
•	Requirements were derived from the product backlog.
•	Development tasks were prioritized based on value.
•	Features were implemented incrementally.
•	Testing was performed after each feature implementation.
•	Refactoring was applied to improve maintainability.

How to Run the Program
1.	Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2.	Download or clone the project repository.
3.	Navigate to the project directory.
4.	Run the application:
python main.py
5.	Follow the on-screen menu prompts.
________________________________________
Example Usage Flow
1.	Launch the program
2.	Select:
o	1 to add an event
o	2 to view events
o	3 to register an attendee
o	4 to cancel an event
o	5 to search for events
3.	Enter required information when prompted
________________________________________
Design Considerations
•	Modular functions for each feature
•	Clear separation of responsibilities
•	Input validation for user entries
•	Scalable structure for future enhancements
________________________________________
Future Enhancements
•	Persistent storage (file or database support)
•	Event editing functionality
•	Attendee removal option
•	Sorting events by date
•	Role-based access control
________________________________________
Learning Outcomes
Through this lab, we gained insight into:
•	How development methodology affects workflow
•	The importance of structured processes
•	Incremental value delivery
•	Adaptability to evolving requirements
